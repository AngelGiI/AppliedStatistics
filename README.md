**Applied Statistics**

This repository contains exercises and projects completed during my Applied Statistics course. The course emphasized data analysis, experimental design, and regression modeling using R programming.

### Key Topics:
- **Design of Experiments (DoE):** Understanding variability, controlling experimental conditions, and analyzing the results through ANOVA.
- **Linear Regression Modeling:** Building and interpreting regression models to explain relationships between variables and make predictions.

The work combines statistical concepts with practical implementation in R, showcasing real-world applications in science, engineering, and data-driven decision-making.
